The main issues remaining have much to do with fastAPI method and the get_paper_info. 

## few notes
# next steps, use the universal sentence encoder to create a vector of embedded cosine similarity scores
# next, use the NetworkX library in python to create the force-Directed graphs in pythoin
# we Will show 10 similar papers from the given DOI, our graph will show the similarity of these papers based on the cosine similarity
